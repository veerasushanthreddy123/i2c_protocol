📄 I2C Protocol Project Document
This is my project document explaining the I2C protocol — including its frame format, block diagrams, project workflow, and sample outputs.

📁 What’s Inside

Overview of I2C communication
Detailed I2C frame format (Start, Address, R/W, Data, ACK/NACK, Stop)
Block diagrams of the system
Project implementation steps
Sample simulation/output results


🎯 Goal
To understand and document I2C protocol fundamentals — especially its standard data frame structure — useful for learning or reference!
